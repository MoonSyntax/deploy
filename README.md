# ü¶â CodeSage ‚Äì AI-Powered Pull Request Reviews for GitHub

> **CodeSage** is an intelligent GitHub App that automates code reviews using advanced AI models. It detects bugs, validates PR titles, identifies dependencies, and uncovers semantic duplication ‚Äî all within the existing GitHub workflow.

##  Key Features

-  **AI-Powered Pull Request Analysis**  
  CodeSage leverages state-of-the-art AI models such as Google Gemini and GPT-4 to automatically analyze pull request diffs, detect potential bugs, identify anti-patterns, and provide actionable suggestions to improve code quality.

-  **PR Title Validation (with Notion Rules)**  
 It validates pull request titles against dynamic, organization-specific naming rules defined in Notion, ensuring consistency, clarity, and adherence to team conventions.

-  **Inline AI Suggestions**  
  The app provides intelligent, context-aware feedback by posting inline comments directly on the relevant lines of code, offering developers human-like guidance within the GitHub interface.
-  **PR Summarization**  
 CodeSage generates concise, readable summaries of code changes, making it easier for reviewers to grasp the overall context and purpose of a pull request ‚Äî even when it spans large or complex diffs.
-  **Code Dependency Impact Analysis**  
  By tracing semantic relationships between code modules, the app assesses how a proposed change might affect other components in the system, helping teams identify hidden risks and maintain code stability.

-  **Semantic Duplicate Detection**  
  Using advanced analysis techniques, CodeSage can detect functionally similar code blocks across the repository, even when they differ in structure or syntax ‚Äî enabling teams to eliminate redundancy and promote reusability.

-  **Token-Aware Diff Chunking**  
  To ensure efficient processing of large pull requests, CodeSage automatically splits diffs into manageable segments using syntax-aware parsing. This enables accurate review while staying within the token limits of AI models.
